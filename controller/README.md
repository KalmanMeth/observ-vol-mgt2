The controller is responsible for managing the behavior of volume management across the set of processors and collectors. It analyses the behavior of the observability signals and correlate those with customer requirements, and with the usage of the signals in the system to generate recommendations and automatically update the configurations to reduce the volume of observability data.

## modules
